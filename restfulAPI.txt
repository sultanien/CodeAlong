REST APIs are an industry-standard way for web services to send and receive data. 
They use HTTP request methods to make the request-response cycle 
and typically transfer data using JSON.

HTTP method	        CRUD	                Action
GET	                read	        returns requested data
POST	            create	        creates a new record
PUT or PATCH	    update	        updates an existing record
DELETE	            delete	        deletes an existing record
